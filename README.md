# basic chrome extensions


As a way to play around with tools, and automate repetitive tasks. Of
course I don't use Chrome (I use the Brave browser) but these
extensions work in Brave just as well as they do in Chrome.

In case someone wants to try the extension(s) here, they can just
clone or download the repo, then in <chrome://extensions> or
<brave://extensions>, enable developer mode,  click on 'Load unpacked'
then select the folder of the particular extension you'd like to use!
